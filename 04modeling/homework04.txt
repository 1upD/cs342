1. BOOK(Book_title, Author_name, Book_type, List_price, Author_affil, Publisher)

Book_title -> Publisher, Book_type
Book_type -> List_price
Author_name -> Author_affil

The relation satisfies 1NF because each attribute's values are indivisible.
The relation does not satisfy BCNF. The functional dependency Author_name -> Author_affil
is nontrivial and Author_name is not a superkey of BOOK.

2. a. According to the assumptions about the problem, year is functionally determined by
book name and edition.
Therefore a candidate key for the relation is {Book_name, Author, Edition}. The only other
candidate key is the entire relation, {Book_name, Author, Edition, Copyright_Year}.
2. b.
