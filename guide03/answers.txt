1. Read Chapter 3.
	a. Compare and contrast the database and the software design processes. Are agile modeling practices applicable to database design as well?
		
	
	b. Explain the following terms: entities, relationships (including cardinality and participation constraints), attributes (simple, composite, multi-valued and derived).
		Entity: A real, discrete, independent object that can be described by one or more attributes, while simple attribrutes are indivisible. 
		Relationship: A reference from one entity to another entity.
		Attribute: A property of an entity. Composite attributes can be split into multiple attributes. 
	c. Explain weak entities and identifying relationships.
		Weak entity types are entity types that do not have keys. An identifying relationship relates a weak entity type to a strong entity type.
	d. Model a person-household database (from class 2) using an ERD.
		

Note the ERD reference sheet in Figure 3.14.

2. Read Chapter 9.
	a. Map the ERD model from above to a relational database model.

	b. Explain how to map from a UML model to a relational database model. We will address this issue more carefully in a later unit (on object-relational mapping).
