1. Chapter 1

	a. Compare and contrast data, databases, database (management) systems and information systems.

	Data are recordable facts with implicit meaning. A database is simply a collection of data. Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software applications that enable databases to be created, stored, and manipulated. An information system contains both a DBMS and one or more databases.
	
	b. Compare and contrast database systems with the following, using the main characteristics of the database approach in your discussion. 
		* data structures and algorithms
		* traditional file systems
		
	Databases are similar to a data structure in that they store data. The data structures used to implement a database will depend on the DBMS. The main difference between a database and a file system is that a database has some sort of structure for data in which each datum in a category (i.e. a table) is comparable.
		
	c. Identify the stakeholders of database systems.
	
	- Database administrators
	- Database designers
	- End users (Various)
