1. Basic SQL (Section 6.3) — Review basic SQL as needed, then write sample queries that:

	a. Use one or more tuple variables (Section 6.3.2).
		SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName
		FROM Performer AS P, Casting AS C, Movie AS M
		WHERE C.movieID = M.id AND C.performerId = P.id AND Movie.title = 'Star Wars';
	
	
	b. Use one or more of the set operations, e.g., UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT (Section 6.3.4).
		
	
	

2. Advanced SQL (Sections 7.1.1–7.1.5) — This will include more new material; write sample queries that:

	a. Select based on a NULL field value (Section 7.1.1).

	b. Implement a nested sub-query, using [NOT] EXISTS, IN, ANY or ALL (Sections 7.1.2–7.1.4).

	c. Implement a correlated sub-query (Section 7.1.3).
