1. Chapter 5 (focus primarily on Sections 5.1â€“5.2)

	a. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?
		The relational model was introduced by Ted Codd in 1970. 
	
	b. Explain the following terms:
		i. relation
			A relation connects related data points to an entity or concept, typically stored in a table as a row.
		ii. attribute
			One member of a relation. Relations are defined as a list of attributes.
		iii. domain
			Possible values of A in a relation schema.
		iv. n-tuple
			Ordered list of values within an attribute domain.
		v. NULL value
			A value included in the domain of all attributes that represents attributes that are unknown or not applicable.
		vi. primary, foreign, candidate and super keys
			A set of attributes that is unique within a relation schema are super keys. If there is more than one possible key for a relation schema, they are known as candidate keys.  The primary key is the candidate key used to identify a relation within a schema.
		vii. referenced and referencing records
			A referenced relation is identified by a foreign key in another relation, known as the referencing relation.

	c. Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.
		Attribute values in a tuple are ordered, but tuples in a relation are not ordered. Each tuple is distinct, but values within the tuple may not to be ordered depending on what datum is being modeled by the tuple.
	
	d. Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?
		No, within an n-tuple each attribute must have one value.
