1. Read Section 30.1:
	a. Name and explain the four kinds of control measures required for database security.
		Access Control - Creating user accounts and passwords to control logins to the DBMS
		Inference Control - Ensures data about individuals cannot be deduced from aggregate data.
		Flow Control - Prevent information from flowing to unauthorized users
		Data Encryption - Encrypt vital data that is communicated over a network
		

	b. Compare and contrast information security and information privacy.
		Securty - How well can a system protect access to information it contains
		Privacy - How well does the use of personal information conform to implicit assumptions about that use.

2. Read Imperva’s Top 5 Database Security Threats.
	a. Name and explain the security threats discussed in the article.
		1. Excessive, inappropriate, and unused privileges
			Any database privilege that isn't strictly required by a job should not be granted to prevent abuse of data.
		2. Privilege abuse
			Users with legitimate database privileges such as system administrators can easily take advantage of those privileges for unauthorized purposes. For this reason, system administrators should not access data directly.
		3. Insufficient web application security
			Data may be exposed through web applications. SQL Injection is one example of an attack that takes advantage of a web application.
		4. Weak audit trails
			Failure to monitor abnormalities and collect information about database activity represents an organizational risk.
		5. Unsecured storage media
			Backup copies are particularly vulnerable to theft.
