My test data was hand written to reflect the types of games I am interested in collecting data on using this schema. Dates and URLs were found online by searching Steam for the relevant games. To test the schema with a larger dataset, I could hand write the engine and gameplay category tables and then automtically generate the rest of the data.

Each relation in this schema satisfies BCNF.
Player(playerID, username) has functional dependency playerID -> username, but playerID is a candidate key (and the primary key) of Player.
Engine(engineID, engineName, dateReleased) has functional dependency engineName -> dateReleased, but engineName is a candidate key of Engine.
Game(gameID, gameName, gameURL, dateReleased, engineID) likewise has attributes functionally dependent on its name, which is a candidate key.
Review(reviewID, playerID, gameID, dateSubmitted, rating, reviewComment) confused me because it is not clear to me if playerID and gameID functionally determine rating and reviewComment.
That is not the case because a player could submit multiple reviews of the same game with different ratings at different times. It is possible for someone to play a game again, change their mind, and write a second review at a different date. With that in mind, rating and review comment are functionally determined by playerID, gameID, and date submitted, which are a candidate key given a unique constraint.
Chapter(chapterName, chapterNumber, gameId) has only one functional dependency, (chapterNumber, gameID) -> chapterName. The left side of the dependency is a candidate key and the primary key.
GameplayCategory has no functional dependencies.
GameplayElement has one functional dependency, gameplayElementName -> categoryID. The former is a candidate key.
ReviewChapter(reviewID, chapterNumber, minutesPlayed, datePlayed, rating, chapterComment) is similar to Review. Some fields are functionally dependent on (reviewID, chapterNumber) which is the primary key.
The same goes for IntroducedElement and TestedElement.

Additionally, each relation satisfies 4NF.
Player does not have any multivalue dependencies.
Engine does not have any multivalue dependencies.
Game does not have any multivalue dependencies.
Review does not have any multivalue dependencies.
Chapter may be considered to have multivalue dependency gameID => chapterNumber, however I would discount this dependency because not every game has the same number of chapter numbers.
Likewise, ReviewChapter may be considered to have multivalue dependency reviewID => chapterNumber because for each review, one ReviewChapter record should exist for each Chapter record. I would discount this dependency because for incomplete reviews, not every review will have ever chapter number. Additionally, the chapter numbers are different per review based on which game is being reviewed.
