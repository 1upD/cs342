My project is a level design database for video games and game modifications. In my spare time, I like to participate in level design challenges online. I have built a database that stores information about games and game mods (user-created levels for existing games) that can be helpful in the design process. Specifically, I look for different commonly used types of puzzles, their frequency, and their placement within games. I also track things like the introduction of enemy types and weapons. The scope of the database is currently limited to modifications of one particular game, Half-Life 2. Since some information about the design of game levels is subjective, the database remains objective by logging reports about given levels per user. Information about the user can be used to help interpret information about the level.
