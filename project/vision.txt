My project will be a level design database for video games and game modifications. In my spare time, I like to participate in level design challenges online. I could build a database that would store information about games and game mods (user-created levels for existing games) that would be helpful in the design process. Specifically, I would look for different commonly used types of puzzles, their frequency, and their placement within games. I would also track things like the introduction of enemy types and weapons. The scope of the database would be limited to first person shooters or possibly just modifications of one particular game, Half-Life 2. Since some information about the design of game levels is subjective, the database would remain objective by logging reports about given levels per user. Information about the user can be used to help interpret information about the level.
