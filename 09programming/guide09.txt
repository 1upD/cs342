1. a. i.	Compare and contrast B-trees and B+-trees.
	The difference between a B-tree and a B+-tree is that a B+-tree only stores data pointers in leaf nodes, while a B-tree may store data in internal nodes.
1. a. ii.	Explain what it means for such a tree to be balanced.
1. a. iii.	Compare and contrast tree and data pointers.
1. b.		Explain the nature of multiple-attribute indexes (see the introduction to Section 17.4).
1. c.		Explain the nature of hash and bitmap indexes (see Sections 17.5.1–2).
1. d. i.	Explain the concept of physical database design (PDD).
1. d. ii.	Compare and contrast the uses for B-tree, hash and bitmap indexes in PDD.
1. d. iii.	Explain whether denormalization should be considered a form of PDD.
2. a.		Explain the concept of query optimization (see the introduction to the chapter).
3. a.		Load the small version of the Internet Movie DB defined in the repo (cs342/databases/imdb), configure the auto-trace facility in SQL*Plus (SET SERVEROUTPUT ON; & SET AUTOTRACE ON;) and generate an execuation plan for some simple query. What is the execution plan operation used and what does that operation do?

3. b. iv.	HASH JOIN
3. b. v.	INDEX UNIQUE SCAN
