1. Chapter 1

	a. Compare and contrast data, databases, database (management) systems and information systems.

	Data are recordable facts with implicit meaning. A database is simply a collection of data. Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software applications that enable databases to be created, stored, and manipulated. An information system contains both a DBMS and one or more databases.
	
	b. Compare and contrast database systems with the following, using the main characteristics of the database approach in your discussion. 
		* data structures and algorithms
		* traditional file systems
		
	Databases are similar to a data structure in that they store data. The data structures used to implement a database will depend on the DBMS. The main difference between a database and a file system is that a database has some sort of structure for data in which each datum in a category (i.e. a table) is comparable.
		
	c. Identify the stakeholders of database systems.
	
	- Database administrators
	- Database designers
	- End users (Various)

2. Chapter 2

	a. Explain the significance of the categories of data models. Which type of model is displayed in Figure 2.1?
		Conceptual Data Models: Approximation of the way users perceive data.
		Physical Data Models: Describe how data is stored in computer storage media.
		Representational Data Models: Midpoint between conceptual and physical data models, can be understood by users but also implemented on a system.


	b. Explain the structure and significance of the three-schema architecture.
		Internal schema: Physical storage structure
		Conceptual schema: Structure of the entire database for a community of users
		External schemas: Schemas that describe part of the database for a particular user group
	
	c. Explain the tiers used in a typical web-based information system.
		Client - Web interface
		Web server - Programs used for business logic and access control
		Database Server - DBMS
