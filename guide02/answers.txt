1. Chapter 5 (focus primarily on Sections 5.1â€“5.2)

	a. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?
		The relational model was introduced by Ted Codd in 1970. 
	
	b. Explain the following terms:
		i. relation
			A relation connects related data points to an entity or concept, typically stored in a table as a row.
		ii. attribute
			One member of a relation. Relations are defined as a list of attributes.
		iii. domain
			Possible values of A in a relation schema.
		iv. n-tuple
			Ordered list of values within an attribute domain.
		v. NULL value
			A value included in the domain of all attributes that represents attributes that are unknown or not applicable.
		vi. primary, foreign, candidate and super keys
			A set of attributes that is unique within a relation schema are super keys. If there is more than one possible key for a relation schema, they are known as candidate keys.  The primary key is the candidate key used to identify a relation within a schema.
		vii. referenced and referencing records
			

	c. Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.

	d. Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?
